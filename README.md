# bank-statement-utility
This is a new repo for automating bank statement processing. 
One of the previous repos which was started with a friend of mine
is available [here on GitHub.](https://github.com/mattandersoninf/convert-bank-statement-to-expense-report)

Credits to Matt for starting the work with Google Drive, but to breathe new life 
into this effort (and help quickly get my finances together) I want to start 
fresh with as little tasks needed as possible. From there, I will expand to
include the work we were doing, and more.
